## This build was specificly made for RunarMC
## This repository is based on @tinytengu 's <a href="https://github.com/tinytengu/minecraft-authlib">Repository</a>
This is the source code of Minecraft's `authlib 1.6.25` updated to `2.1.28` which you can use from Minecraft 1.16.5 inclusive (*1.16.4 introduced social interactions so this library got changed to v2*) both on the client and the server.

I don't own anything of this library, so if something happens, Mojang will sue you ðŸ—¿
